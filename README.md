This repo includes the code written for a recent coding assesment performend by an Energy Analytics firm together with my results 
Analysis includes visualization of production data, together with EDA and model training/testing.

Best accuracy was obtained using Chronos. 
A separate function was build to predict production for each well within a few seconds using Chronos.
